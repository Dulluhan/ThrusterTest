# ThrusterTest

Thruster test code for AUV Jormungandr


`image.sh` is for running all the nodes and settings for connecting to the fisheye camera we use  

`controller_test.py` reads keyboard input and sends it to arduino. Change serial based on what the arduino connects to on your computer

The `thruster_test` folder holds `thruster_test.ino` file which was the arduino code used to test the thrusters
